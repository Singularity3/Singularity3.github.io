Hello! I'm Chris and/or Teal, a hobbyist game designer, fledgling musician, and professional code enthusiast. I love the weirder side of art and programming, and I'd argue that they overlap a great deal!

I'm committed to open-source design, and as such my toolkit is itself predominantly open source! My favorite game engine is [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), a wonderful, feature-rich alternative to Unity that (in my opinion) has much more intuitive structure.

[Processing](https://processing.org/) is my go-to language for generative art and simulation projects, and my favorite language to teach. [Python](https://www.python.org/) is also pretty cool for data and machine learning stuff.

This site is built on [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/), which is built on [Poole](https://getpoole.com/), which is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Tech stacks are pretty wild these days.
