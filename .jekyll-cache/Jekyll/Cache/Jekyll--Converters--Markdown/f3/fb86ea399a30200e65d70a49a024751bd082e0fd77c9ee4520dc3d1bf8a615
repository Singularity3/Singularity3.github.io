I"ù<p>This page is for some of the cooler games Iâ€™ve made.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t tend to post ongoing projects anywhere, as I find that talking about them makes them harder to work on. However, I am working on a few, and bits of them might have snuck onto the <a href="/artwork">Artwork</a> pageâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="4ork"><a href="https://github.com/Singularity3/fork_game">4ork</a></h2>

<p>A game about hacking the people doinâ€™ bad stuff through some very retro terminals.</p>

<p>This is probably the biggest game Iâ€™ve made so far, and thatâ€™s mostly because I decided to write an engine instead of using a perfectly good one someone else had made already. Admittedly, I didnâ€™t know about Godot at the time, Iâ€™m not the biggest fan of Unity, and Unreal seemedâ€¦overkill. So I grabbed a framework and set out to try and make Lua into an object-oriented language.</p>

<p>Honestly, Iâ€™d recommend anyone who is interested in the technical side of making games to try creating an engine at least once. Just maybe donâ€™t do it when youâ€™re under time pressure.</p>

<p>There are a lot of puzzles, a few pieces of music, and someâ€¦dialogue? Honestly if I had to go back and do it again I wouldâ€™ve scrapped a lot of the dialogue; itâ€™s pretty rough. But Iâ€™m happy with how itâ€™s presented, at least!</p>

<p>The repo contains builds for Windows and Mac; I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<h2 id="analogdigital"><a href="https://singularity3.itch.io/analogdigital">Analog/Digital</a></h2>

<p>A little dodging game I made for a game jam! Move with the arrow keys, and hold Space to change from analog movement to digital!</p>

<p>Uses some leftover music I had from 4ork.</p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-bennys"><a href="#">Welcome to Bennyâ€™s</a></h2>

<p>A little game about trying to start a pizza franchise on an alien planet. Written in raw JS, for fun. Whatâ€™s CSS?</p>

<p>I like to think this game demonstrates that my writing has improved significantly since the 4ork days, though itâ€™s probably because I had a lot less to actually write. Also not having to do dialogue helps. Dialogue is a cursed discipline.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to play, grab some early contracts so you can keep making pizza, and donâ€™t neglect marketing!</p>

<h2 id="magic-tennis"><a href="https://github.com/Singularity3/magic-tennis-multiplayer">Magic Tennis</a></h2>

<p>Probably the most fun game Iâ€™ve made. Unfortunately, this one requires hosting on a node.js server, and I shut mine down after <em>somebody</em> managed to sneak into it and started botting.</p>

<p>However, if youâ€™d like to host it yourself, go for it! Youâ€™ll need to install sockets.io and the p5.js libraries onto the server as well.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll probably get another server up and running one of these days, but in the meantime, <a href="">hereâ€™s a video of the game in action.</a> This was my first time working with netcode for a game, and while it has some unfortunate failings, I did manage to implement functional rollback netcode, which at least puts me above the Street Fighter 5 devs.</p>
