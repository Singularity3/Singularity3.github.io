I"y<p>This page is for some of the cooler games I’ve made.</p>

<p>I also have an itch.io page, which includes the more prototypey stuff.</p>

<p>I don’t tend to post ongoing projects anywhere, as I find that talking about them makes them harder to work on. However, I am working on a few, and bits of them might have snuck onto the <a href="/artwork">Artwork</a> page…</p>
