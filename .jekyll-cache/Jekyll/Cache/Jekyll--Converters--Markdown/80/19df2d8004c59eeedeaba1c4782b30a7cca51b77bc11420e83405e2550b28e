I"å<p>Hello! Iâ€™m Chris and/or Teal, a hobbyist game designer, fledgling musician, and professional code enthusiast. I love the weirder side of art and programming, and Iâ€™d argue that they overlap a great deal!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m committed to open-source design, and as such my toolkit is itself predominantly open source! My favorite game engine is <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a>, a wonderful, feature-rich alternative to Unity that (in my opinion) has much more intuitive structure.</p>

<p><a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> is my go-to language for generative art and simulation projects, and my favorite language to teach. <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is also pretty cool for data and machine learning stuff.</p>

<p>This site is built on <a href="https://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a>, which is built on <a href="https://getpoole.com/">Poole</a>, which is built on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Tech stacks are pretty wild these days.</p>
